print("Let\'s go\n") #python doesn't know that '"' is a symbol in a string
print("Let\"s go\n") #we have to use a "\" to make it a symbol in string

print("C:\\n now\n") #same as the first line
print(r"C:\n\now") #we can use r to make a row string which mean all the symbols in a string are not syntax
